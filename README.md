# cAIculator

This is the most modern calculator in the world.
Uses the latest technology like Rust, Iced and AI ofcourse!
Yes AI.
To run it you need to have local ollama instance.

## Why should I use it?
 - It's slow
 - Need lot of RAM
 - Need lot of CPU/GPU power
 - Might be mistaken

## Why I created it?
Because AI is everywhere, and now I'm an AI engineer too! Right? RIGHT?

I bet some big company will buy it for a billion of dollars!

## How to use it?
 - fetch this repo
 - install ollama
 - run ollama server: `ollama serve`
 - fetch some models: `ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:0.5b`
 - run the calculator: `cargo run`
 - have fun!
